This is a top-down arcade style zombie shooter. It's round based, and there isn't an end until you've run out of health.
To play the game, go to the 'build' folder and run the '3DTopDownZombieShooter.exe' executable file. Use the Unity
interface to start the game. Once the game begins, the game will immediately start.

Controls:

1 -> pistol
2 -> machine gun
3 -> shotgun
4 -> knife

WASD movement

The red and blue pickups are ammo for the machine gun and shot gun respectively.

The white, green and purple pickups are powerups for Infinite Ammo, One Hit Kill, and Invincibility respectively.

Have fun!
